For this project, my group and I explored a comercial hairdryer as a fluid mechanical system. We all contributed to the dissection, and for the analysis I mainly focused on setting up the governing equations and modeling the fan as an actuator disk. The first equation was conservation of mass, which states that as the area gets smaller, the velocity has to increase in order for the mass flow rate to remain constant.
The second was Bernoulli’s principle, which relates the pressure and velocity along the path of the flow. This helped us understand how the converging nozzle affects the pressure distribution. The third was the actuator disk model, which is how we represented the fan. This model gives us an estimate of how the fan increases the velocity when adding energy to the air. I also created a diagram depicting the inlet, fan section, and outlet along with the velocities and areas we used in these equations. The reason we chose to model the fan as an actuator disk was to be able to apply Bernoulli on the venturi after the fcn. The actuator disk model allowed us to solve for the speed of the working fluid (air) after the fan to then calculate the pressure difference in the nozzle.
